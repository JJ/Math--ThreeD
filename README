A relatively efficient (but still pure Perl 6) 3D math library, generated
procedurally. Useful for anything from building a ray tracer to writing a
twitch game to simulating simple physics. Currently supports 3-element vectors
and 4x4 matrices.

When building this module under JVM, you may need to add something along the
lines of "-Xms500m -Xmx2g" in the perl6-j runner if you encounter
out-of-memory errors.

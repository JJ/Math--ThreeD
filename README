NOTE:  UNUSABLE WORK IN PROGRESS!

Just the bare beginnings of an idea: generating relatively efficient
(but still pure Perl 6) code for a 3D math library, useful for anything
from building a ray tracer to writing a twitch game to simulating simple
physics.

Right now this is *NOT* in a useful state -- it is being posted to share
the hacking, not because it's ready.

Did I mention it's not ready?  Oh good.
